## üöÄ Implementation Notes

### üîê API Keys Management & Security

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**: API key management involves significant security risks that must be understood and mitigated.

#### Required API Services
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for storing code embeddings
  - **Data Exposure**: Code chunks stored as vectors in Pinecone's cloud service
  - **Access Level**: Full read/write access to vector database
  - **Cost Impact**: Storage and query costs based on usage

- **Gemini (Google AI)**: Embedding generation service
  - **Data Exposure**: Code content processed by Google's AI service
  - **Access Level**: Text processing and embedding generation
  - **Cost Impact**: API calls charged per token processed

#### Security Implementation
- **Secure Storage**: Use VS Code Secret Storage API for encrypted credential storage
- **Access Control**: API keys never logged, displayed, or stored in plain text
- **Transmission Security**: All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when keys are unavailable
- **User Notifications**: Clear error messages for authentication issues

#### Security Best Practices for Users
1. **API Key Security**:
   - Use dedicated API keys with minimal required permissions
   - Regularly rotate API keys (monthly recommended)
   - Monitor API usage and costs continuously
   - Never share or commit API keys to version control

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Only use with non-proprietary, non-sensitive code
   - Review API provider terms of service and privacy policies
   - Understand data retention policies of external services
   - Consider geographic data residency requirements

3. **Access Control**:
   - Limit API key permissions to minimum required functionality
   - Use separate API keys for different projects/environments
   - Implement API usage monitoring and alerts
   - Document API usage for compliance audits

4. **Compliance Considerations**:
   - Verify compliance with organizational security policies
   - Check data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Obtain necessary approvals before using with work-related code
   - Maintain audit trails for API usage

#### Emergency Procedures
- **API Key Compromise**: Immediate revocation and regeneration procedures
- **Excessive Usage**: Automatic disable mechanisms and cost controls
- **Service Outages**: Fallback strategies and user notifications
- **Data Breach**: Incident response and user notification procedures

#### Disable/Enable Instructions
**Complete Disablement**:
1. Set `vscode-snapshots.semanticSearch.enabled` to `false`
2. Remove API keys from VS Code SecretStorage
3. Clear local index files and cached data
4. Verify no residual API calls are being made

**Safe Re-enablement**:
1. Review security policies and obtain necessary approvals
2. Configure API keys with minimal required permissions
3. Test with non-sensitive code first
4. Monitor initial usage for unexpected behavior
5. Gradually expand usage based on security assessment

### Chunking Strategy

- Prioritize semantic boundaries (functions, classes) when possible
- Balance chunk size and context preservation
- Use different strategies for different languages
- Consider file size when determining chunking approach

### Embedding Optimization

- Cache embeddings to reduce API calls
- Use batch processing to minimize requests
- Include metadata in embedding context for better results
- Implement rate limiting compliance

### Search Experience

- Prioritize result quality over quantity
- Provide meaningful context in search results
- Enable rapid navigation between results
- Maintain search history for quick access

## üìà Metrics for Success

- **Indexing Performance**: Aim for indexing 100 files per minute
- **Search Latency**: Target < 2 seconds for search completion
- **Result Quality**: Aim for 80%+ relevance on benchmark queries
- **Memory Usage**: Keep peak memory under 500MB during operations
- **User Experience**: Measure task completion time for common searches

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Skills
